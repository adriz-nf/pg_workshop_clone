In this repository we will introduce Python as alternative way to approach Data Analysis projects. Furthermore, Jupyter Notebooks are outlined in more detail as useful file format to do structured, well-documented analyses. Last but not least using Python for automating workflows will be covered in the end of this repo.

The different notebooks will guide you through the above mentioned topics.

Please work through the notebooks as directed by the coaches.
If you have questions, issues or get stuck, please ask your coaches for help.
